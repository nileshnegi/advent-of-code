    "Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, `take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2`. The Fuel Counter-Upper needs to know the total fuel requirement. To find it, individually calculate the fuel needed for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), then add together all the fuel values. What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?\n",

Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.  \n",
